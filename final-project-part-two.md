# Wireframes / storyboards

Using last week’s sketches as a base, I developed a more concrete storyboard:

1) Opening (hook)

  Wireframe: Full width text panel “Sleep is one of the first things sacrificed in demanding careers.”

  Supporting chart: Recommended 7–9 hours of sleep vs. dataset average (~6 hours).

2) Conflict / antagonist

  Wireframe: Stress visualized as the main driver.

  Scatterplot: Stress levels (x-axis) vs. sleep duration (y-axis). Clear cluster for high 3pressure jobs          (engineers, doctors, sales reps).

3)Occupation spotlight

  Wireframes: Persona cards with charts.

  Doctors = high stress + shortest sleep.

  Engineers = moderate stress, slightly better duration but lower quality.

  Sales reps = stress + poor BMI + insomnia symptoms.

  Bar charts to show average sleep hours by occupation.

4)Global context

  Small multiples: Global averages (from WHO / Kaggle datasets) compared to dataset occupations.

  Message: This isn’t just U.S. engineers, stress and sleep struggles are global.

5)Audience connection

  Wireframe: Chart of (stress → less sleep → poorer health) cycle.

  Text overlay: As grad students about to enter these fields, we should prepare not just technically, but        physically and mentally.

6)Closing frame

  Wireframe: Simple statement card, Sleep is not wasted time. It’s the foundation for performance.

  <img width="2600" height="2400" alt="storyboard_wireframe_fixed3" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/616f53f2-8f7b-4b89-bbd4-ab622e1d386c" />

  These simple graphs are in my mind but it will change depending on the context because I want a bit visually appealing. However, it really depends on shortstory template that i will be choose in the persentation.


# User research 
## Target audience

Graduate students in technical / professional programs (especially software engineers and data scientists).

Early career professionals preparing for demanding jobs.

I want to reach individuals who may undervalue sleep as they prepare for career growth.

Approach: Identify peers in the MISM program and other grad students in related programs. These represent the immediate audience for my story and help me align the message with real concerns.


## Interview script
  Understand how graduate students think about sleep and stress in relation to their future jobs.

  Identify what kind of data visualization/story would resonate with them.

  Test whether the “stress steals sleep” framing feels clear and engaging.


|             Goal                     |               Questions to Ask             |
|--------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------|
|Goal	Questions Understand sleep habits|How many hours do you usually sleep on a typical school week?|
|  Anticipate career stress            |  When you think about your future job (software engineer, consultant), what stresses do you expect?                |
|         Relevance of story           |   Does connecting stress and sleep through data feel relevant to you personally?               |
|        Visualization style           |Do you prefer simple charts that are easy to read, or more detailed/fancy ones?|
|           Takeaway                   |     What advice or insight would be most useful for you to get from a project like this?             |

## Interview findings



| Questions               | Interview 1 (MISM peer) | Interview 2(CS grad student) | Interview 3(Engineer working full-time) |
|-------------------------|--------------------------------|-------------|-------------|
|     Sleep habits         |Sleeps 5–6 hours during semester|Sleeps 6–7 hours, but irregular|5 hours during deadlines, 7 otherwise|
|Anticipated stress|      Balancing client projects + deadlines                          |           Long hours in tech companies  |     Deliverables + “always-on” work culture        |
|Relevance of story|    Said “yes, this is exactly what we’re going to deal with”   |     Said “makes sense, I already expect stress”  |     Would have been nice to know this before starting work        |
|Visualization style |Prefers clean and simple, not too fancy |Likes interactive dashboards| Charts are fine, but keep it clear|
|Takeaway|Wants advice on how to manage stress better|Wants comparison to other jobs|Highlight "the health cost of no sleep"|

# Identified changes for Part III
Maybe because of initial sketches had too many errors, which makes sense. Also, In terms of make my own story, The story was too broad, very global demographic information, which is understandable, that peers asking more niche area that i could cover it. 

| Research synthesis                       | Anticipated changes for Part III                                                |
|------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
|Students already anticipate stress        | Make stress "sleep connection very explicit early"                              |
|    Audience wants advice                 | Add a short “what you can do” section at the end                                |
| Interest in comparisons                  |   Keep global data comparison to strengthen insight                             |

                                                                          
# Moodboards / personas
Persona cards I plan to include:

“Amir, Software Engineer” — 27, high stress, ~6 hours of sleep, worried about deadlines.

“Jia, Grad Student” — 25, sleeps 5.5 hours during exams, anticipates consulting job stress.

Moodboard: Professional, academic but approachable. Colors = calm blues for sleep, sharp reds for stress.

But i don't know yet because writing might be conflict, and demonstration might be problem.
